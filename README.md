This package makes it easy to integrate job board APIs into your application. Whether you want to aggregate job board data, or supplement your site's job listings with listings from third party providers, or anything else you can dream up, this package (and the api clients listed below) can help.

This package is compliant with [PSR-1][], [PSR-2][], [PSR-4][], and [PSR-7][]. If you notice compliance oversights, please send a patch via pull request.

[PSR-1]: https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md
[PSR-2]: https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md
[PSR-4]: https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md

## Requirements

The following versions of PHP are supported.

* PHP 5.5
* PHP 5.6
* PHP 7.0
* HHVM

## Usage
This package is not meant to be used on its own, but rather it is used by the providers listed below to access job board APIs and gather results in a standard data format. For details on creating your own job board provider, read on!

## Providers

Each job board supported has a provider that must extend this package's [AbstractProvider](https://github.com/jobapis/jobs-common/blob/master/src/Provider/AbstractProvider.php), and implement the declared abstract methods.

The following providers are available:

### Official providers

There are many job board services we support officially.

### Third party providers

If you would like to support other providers, please make them available as a Composer package, then link to them
below.

These providers allow integration with other providers not supported by `jobs-common`. They may require an older version
so please help them out with a pull request if you notice this.

Gateway | Composer Package | Maintainer
--- | --- | ---
[Job Crank](http://www.jobcrank.com/) | yourname/jobs-jobcrank | [You!](https://github.com)

### Build your own providers

New providers can be created by cloning the layout of an existing package. When choosing a name for your package, please donâ€™t use the `joabpis` vendor prefix, as this implies that it is officially supported.

You should use your own username as the vendor prefix, and prepend `jobs-` to the package name to make it clear that your package works with Jobs Common. For example, if your GitHub username were prometheus, and you were implementing the Dice.com job listing API, a good name for your composer package would be `prometheus/jobs-dice`.

#### Implementing your own provider

If you are working with a job board service not supported out-of-the-box or by an existing package, it is quite simple to implement your own. Simply extend `JobApis\Jobs\Client\Providers\AbstractProvider` and `JobApis\Jobs\Client\Queries\AbstractQuery` and implement the required abstract methods in each:

```php

// JobApis\Jobs\Client\Providers\AbstractProvider

abstract public function createJobObject($payload);

abstract public function getDefaultResponseFields();

abstract public function getListingsPath();


// JobApis\Jobs\Client\Queries\AbstractQuery

abstract public function getBaseUrl();

abstract public function getKeyword();

```

Each of these abstract methods contain a docblock defining their expectations and typical behavior. Once you have extended these classes, you can simply follow the example above using your new `Provider`.

Each job object that is created will automatically set `source` and `query` based on the criteria passed into the provider. If you would like to customize this `source` value, your provider must implement a `getSource` method that returns a string to identify your provider's source.

For an example of each of the concrete classes you'll need to implement, see the `/tests/fixtures` folder in this repository. 

#### Make your provider official

If you want to transfer your provider to the `jobapis` GitHub organization and add it to the list of officially supported providers, please open a pull request on the jobapis/jobs-common package. Before new providers will be accepted, they must have 100% unit test code coverage, and follow the conventions and code style used in other Jobs Client providers.
